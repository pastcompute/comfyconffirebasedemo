# App creation

For the purpose of demonstration I started with the vanilla JS ToDo example from the taste MVC website.
This involved copying the `todomvc/examples/vanillajs/` directory to `app` in this repository

npm install -g http-server

Now we can run `http-server app` and browse to http://localhost:8080 to run it

Then I added in a very simple and probably buggy authentication dialog and persistence, to be able to demonstrate the Firebase permissions.

## Firebase integration
